Resource Allocation in V2X Network via Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to the Resource Allocation in V2X Network code repository. This project addresses the optimization problem of minimizing the Age of Information (AoI) for vehicles in a vehicular network by leveraging reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) approach. In this algorithm, each vehicle acts as an agent.

Note: Please ensure that all the required files are located in their specified folders to ensure smooth operation.

Important: The code loads weights for the actor and critic neural networks. If you plan to change the number of actions or states, it may result in errors. In such cases, it is recommended to comment out the code responsible for loading neural network weights during the first episode.

This code is designed to run on various systems, including Windows, and is compatible with the PyTorch framework. Python is an essential runtime requirement for executing the code.

Thank you for choosing this project, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance. Happy coding!
